    DESCRIPTION
  </p>
  <p class="p2">
    This application allows you to select the Steam servers on which you want to play for Counter Strike : Global
    Offensive. <br>
    Administrator rights are required to
    block the IP addresses of the servers. For security reasons, requests for rights are systematic with each click on
    the "GO" and "Reset" buttons. <br>
    The IP addresses are automatically updated without any action on my part and the application is updated
    automatically. <br>
    The application is developed with the <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> framework and its source code
    is available on my <a href="https://github.com/Jyben/csgo-mm-server-picker">Github</a>. <br>
    I accept pull requests only for bug fixes.
